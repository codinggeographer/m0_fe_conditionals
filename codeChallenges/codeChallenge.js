// mild challenge
// var number = 2
// var number = 5
// the if statement is taking the assigned number, dividing it by 2
// and checks if the remainder of the division is equal to 0. This would
// mean that it is an even number. The else prints odd because
// the remaining amount of number / 2 != 0
if (number % 2==0) {
